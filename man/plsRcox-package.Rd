Partial least squares Regression for generalized linear models
}
\description{
This packages provides Partial least squares Regression for generalized linear models and kfold crossvalidation of such models using various criteria. It allows for missing data in the eXplanatory variables. Bootstrap confidence intervals constructions are also available.
